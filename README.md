This project was born as a "school project" about game feel and polishing. The first step was done in 1 month (I was alone) and I reached something that i liked.
Now I'm trying to improve it as much as I can, between sports sessions, school studies, other projects...
You can take it and make it better if you want (just mention my name pls ahah), my goal is to create something simple (Casual Game) as clean as possible.
